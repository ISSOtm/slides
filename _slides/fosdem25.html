			🐱 We thought you might appreciate knowing a little more about the speakers than our

			<br />
			My name is Eldred, ⏭️ but I usually go online by the nick “ISSOtm”. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			I got my first Game Boy late, so I have no nostalgia for it. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			I love strongly-typed languages with a lot of static checks, and being down to the metal
			juggling raw bytes, and have a <em>strong</em> distaste for C and C++.

			🐶 My name is Sylvie! ⏭️
			<br />
			I grew up playing a Game Boy Color, a Nintendo 64, and basically didn't upgrade those
			consoles, so I have a <em>lot</em> of nostalgia for them. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			There's a lot I appreciate about high-level languages: functional programming idioms,
			type systems that guarantee correctness, lots of reusable wheels already invented. ⏭️
			<br />
			<br />
			But despite both being "programming", that all feels very different from writing
			procedural code to run directly on a CPU, so I also appreciate it as a hobby.

	<h2>What can make programming unfun?</h2>
	<aside class="notes">
		🐱 Let's get to what you came here for! Since we put “<em>re</em>discovering” in the talk's
		title, let's explore why we might have lost that fun.

		<h3>Barriers to entry</h3>

			</li>
			<li class="fragment">Getting a bunch of dependencies</li>
			<li class="fragment">Needing more powerful hardware</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			🐱 The first thing that drains fun is being taken out of “the zone” to deal with some
			chore. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			For example, waiting for long build times. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			Stressing your network bandwidth (and waiting some more) while it fetches a whole bunch
			of libraries. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			And hardware requirements constantly increasing.

		<h3>Hard to finish complex projects</h3>
		<img

			alt="Humorous image depicting how many jobs a solo game dev has to do at the same time"
			style="max-height: 10em"
		/>
		<aside class="notes">
			🐶 Modern development techniques tend to demand a lot out of many specialized people, so
			it can be barely possible to actually <em>finish</em> something, especially as a solo
			creator.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Hard to wrap your head around</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">Many different targets</li>
			<li class="fragment">And constantly evolving, too!</li>
			<li class="fragment">Debugging suffers</li>
			<li class="fragment">Grasping the overall functioning feels nice</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			🐱 It's also just <em>hard</em>, man! ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			The modern PC platform is very diverse, with a lot of screen sizes, hardware
			combinations and configurations... ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			And each of those targets are moving, to make things worse! ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			This especially hinders debugging, since that necessitates fairly broad understanding of
			the systems you're debugging ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			And, finally, the sensation that things are getting beyond your control just
			<em>doesn't feel great</em>.

		<h3>It's just less complex</h3>

			</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			🐱 The Game Boy's simplicity is refreshing in many ways ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			Not only is it a good support to learn some fundamental lower-level concepts, ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			it remains an interesting object in its own right! ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			Further, one dev (or a small team) can wear more hats at once, without any one of them
			being too big to handle. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			This is, in part, due to the system's lower specs making it easier to have something
			that feels reasonably complete. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			And, yes, the system is under-powered, but that's a *good thing* ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			as the age-old saying goes. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			It can also make it really interesting to have to solve minor challenges to make your
			ideas work on the system

			🐶 Maybe "assembly language" makes you think of long, complex, inscrutable code with too

			<br />
			But on an 8-bit platform like the Game Boy, developers were <em>expected</em> to write

			🐶 You can use practically any graphics editor to draw things one pixel at a time. But
			the Game Boy has more restrictions than that. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			Dedicated editors for pixel art have useful features, like working with limited color
			palettes or animating a frame at a time. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			The original Game Boy could show exactly four shades its famous “pea soup green”. But
			even then, you can use dithering -- mixing colors over space, or even ⏭️ over
			<em>time</em> -- to look like you have more. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			The Game Boy Color supported 32 <em>thousand</em> whole colors -- but still with its own
			limits around how they're divided into palettes and tiles. But once again, you can use
			artistic and programming trickery to create "high-color" cutscenes or demos.

			<br />
			Some people even write emulators <em>on</em> the Game Boy. Due to the system's low

			🐱 Although we just said that the system has been studied a lot, believe it or not,
			research on that 35-yo system is STILL ongoing! ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			One notable area of work is writing what we call “test ROMs”, which enable individual
			behaviours to be compared between implementations (including the, y'know, original
			physical one :P) ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			🐶 And another thing that anyone, yes <em>you</em>, can help with, is documenting all of
			the technical details in a more human-friendly and accessible manner. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			And all of this is also something that other people will gladly help you with!

			🐶 Your idea of "what can run on the Game Boy" might be simple games with obviously
			repeating tiled graphics and beep-boop audio. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			But the hardware can do a <em>lot</em> more than that. And if you want to try pushing
			the limits, ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			you can decide to do away with with a game UI, player controls, any of that, and to
			dedicate all your efforts (and all the Game Boy's CPU) to making something that truly
			stands out. That's something that gets called “a demo”.
