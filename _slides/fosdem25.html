		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			My name is Sylvie!
			<br />
			My sister and I had an Nintendo 64 as kids, I got a Game Boy Color to play Pok√©mon on,
			and we basically didn't upgrade consoles so I have a <em>lot</em> of nostalgia for them.
			:P
			<br />
			I got into programming on a TI calculator with TI-BASIC. Ironically that's
			<em>also</em> a good platform for assembly programming, in Z80, but there can be some
			other retro dev talk about that.
			<br />
			From there I started doing web development in high school and stuck with programming in
			general as a career.
			<br />
			In that field, there's a lot I like about Typescript, Python, C++, Rust, for how they
			let you do abstract work <em>once</em> and then the high-level compiler or interpreter
			handles it.
			<br />
			But on the other hand, it's a very different feeling from manipulating a computing
			machine at its lowest level, which is why I still like assembly programming as a hobby.

		<aside class="notes">
			The first thing that drains fun is being taken out of ‚Äúthe zone‚Äù to deal with some
			chore. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			For example, waiting for long build times. Raise your hand if you have seen that comic
			somewhere before? ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			There's also stressing your network bandwidth (and waiting some more) while you are
			fetching a whole bunch of libraries... ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />

			<br />
			This especially hinders debugging, since that necessitates fairly broad understanding of

		<aside class="notes">
			If you want to program games, there is a variety of languages available: ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			The first, the most historical and original one, is assembly; which, in a nutshell, is
			you directly talking to the CPU. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			Then there's the usual suspect, C; though it's poorly suited for the Game Boy, at least
			currently ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			Thus, some languages have been created to fill the gap, and be a middle-ground between
			assembly's no-frills and C's awkwardness. I'd be surprised if you've ever heard of any
			of them before, but they're nonetheless worth giving a try! ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			You might expect C++ and Rust to be available, being systems languages; unfortunately,
			that is ‚è≠Ô∏è currently not the case. There are ongoing efforts to change that, though.
			‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			Some languages, typically the dynamically-typed, memory-GC'd languages, have essentially
			no hope of ever running on the console. There's been toy implementations (for example
			Micropython), but realistically, they offer nowhere near the Python anyone is used to.

			get into the field, and also non-low level programmers to grow some interest. ‚è≠Ô∏è

		<h3>Emulators</h3>

			<li class="fragment">80% of games are easy to accurately emulate</li>
			<li class="fragment">
				Want difficulty? Try emulating
				<a href="http://eldred.fr/blog/prehistorik"><em>Prehistorik Man</em></a>
				pixel-perfectly... or <em>Pinball Deluxe</em> at all!
			</li>
			<li class="fragment">
				Want fun? Emulate a simpler platform <em>on</em> the Game Boy!
				(e.g. <a href="https://chip-8.github.io/links/">CHIP-8</a>)
			</li>
			<li class="fragment">
				Well-understood (<em>mostly</em>), well-documented,
				<a href="https://gbdev.io/chat">a lot of people</a> can help
			</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			Another interesting field is the world of emulation. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			Emulating the Game Boy on your computer is a common recommendation for newbies, since
			getting it mostly right is not particularly difficult (unlike, say, the NES) ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			That said, if you like a challenge, the Game Boy has a *lot* of headaches in store for
			you! Here are two of the more famous expert-level targets, but don't worry, there's
			*plenty* more where that came from :) ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			Some people even write emulators *on* the Game Boy. Due to the system's low specs, the
			opportunities are rare, but even loerr-spec "fantasy consoles" can be done! ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			Overall, it can a fun activity, because the system has been researched a lot *and* said
			research is publicly available; and there are a lot of people who will readily give you
			a hand. ‚è≠Ô∏è
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Research</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">Running tests on hardware, and making them reproducible</li>
			<li class="fragment">
				Documentation (<a href="https://gbdev.io/pandocs">Pan Docs</a>...)
			</li>
			<li class="fragment">
				Again, can be done as a <a href="https://gbdev.io">community</a> effort
			</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			Although we just said that the system has been studied a lot, believe it or not,
			research on that 35-yo system is STILL ongoing! ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			One notable area of work is writing what we call ‚Äútest ROMs‚Äù, which enable individual
			behaviours to be compared between implementations (including the, yknow, reference one
			:P) ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			And another thing that anyone, yes *you*, can help with, is documenting all of the
			technical details in a more human-friendly and accessible manner. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			And all of this is also something that other people will gladly help you with! ‚è≠Ô∏è
