			My name is Eldred, ⏭️ but I usually go online by the nick “ISSOtm”. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			I got my first Game Boy late, so I have no nostalgia for it. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			I picked up PHP and JS when I was 13, then immediately got introduced to Z80 assembly,
			aaaaand I got hooked ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			I love strongly-typed languages with a lot of static checks, and being down to the metal
			juggling raw bytes, and have a *strong* distaste for C and C++. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			As of late, my hobby has been mapping out the countryside I live in. ⏭️

				<img src="assets/sylvie.png" class="float" />Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color fan
			</li>

			<li class="fragment">Hobbies: assembly and some C</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			My name is Sylvie!
			<br />
			My sister and I had an Nintendo 64 as kids, I got a Game Boy Color to play Pokémon on,
			and we basically didn't upgrade consoles so I have a <em>lot</em> of nostalgia for them.
			:P
			<br />
			I got into programming on a TI calculator with TI-BASIC. Ironically that's
			<em>also</em> a good platform for assembly programming, in Z80, but there can be some
			other retro dev talk about that.
			<br />
			From there I started doing web development in high school and stuck with programming in
			general as a career.
			<br />
			In that field, there's a lot I like about Typescript, Python, C++, Rust, for how they
			let you do abstract work <em>once</em> and then the high-level compiler or interpreter
			handles it.
			<br />
			But on the other hand, it's a very different feeling from manipulating a computing
			machine at its lowest level, which is why I still like assembly programming as a hobby.
			(Hence this talk!)

	<h2>What can make programming unfun?</h2>
	<aside class="notes">
		Let's get to what you came here for! Since we put “**re**discovering” in the talk's title,
		let's explore why we might have lost that fun. ⏭️

		<h3>Barriers to entry</h3>

				Waiting for long compilation
			</li>
			<li class="fragment">Getting a bunch of dependencies</li>
			<li class="fragment">Needing more powerful hardware</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			The first thing that drains fun is being taken out of “the zone” to deal with some
			chore. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			For example, waiting for long build times. Raise your hand if you have seen that comic
			somewhere before? ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			There's also stressing your network bandwidth (and waiting some more) while you are
			fetching a whole bunch of libraries... ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			And hardware requirements constantly increasing. ⏭️

			Modern game development techniques tend to demand a lot out of a single person, so it

			Speaking of complexity, the raw complexity of the systems also makes it difficult to
			grasp what's going on ⏭️<br />

			The modern PC platform is very diverse, with a lot of screen sizes, hardware

			<br />
			And each of those targets are moving, to make things worse! ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			This especially hinders debugging, since that necessitates fairly broad understanding of
			the systems you're debugging ⏭️<br />
			<br />

	<h2>The various kinds of Game Boy development</h2>
	<p class="fragment">This niche has a little something for everybody!</p>
</section>
<section>
	<section>
		<h3>Programming games</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">Assembly</li>
			<li class="fragment">C</li>
			<li class="fragment">
				Niche languages (<a href="https://github.com/bananattack/wiz">Wiz</a>, Millfork,
				TRSE...)
			</li>
			<li class="fragment arrow">Not C++ nor Rust <span class="fragment">(yet)</span></li>
			<li class="fragment cross">Python, JS...</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			If you want to program games, there is a variety of languages available: ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			The first, the most historical and original one, is assembly; which, in a nutshell, is
			you directly talking to the CPU. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			Then there's the usual suspect, C; though it's poorly suited for the Game Boy, at least
			currently ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			Thus, some languages have been created to fill the gap, and be a middle-ground between
			assembly's no-frills and C's awkwardness. I'd be surprised if you've ever heard of any
			of them before, but they're nonetheless worth giving a try! ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			You might expect C++ and Rust to be available, like C; unfortunately, that is ⏭️
			currently not the case. There are ongoing efforts to change that, though. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			Some languages, typically the dynamically-typed, memory-GC'd languages, have essentially
			no hope of ever running on the console. There's been toy implementations (for example
			Micropython), but realistically, they offer nowhere near the Python anyone is used to.

		<h3>No-code games</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">GB Studio</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			As you can probably tell from the number of stickers on my laptop, no-code tools aren't
			really my jam; ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			but GB Studio deserves to be mentioned, since it has enabled many a non-programmer to
			get into the field, and also non-low level programmers to grow some interest. ⏭️

		<h3>Tinkering</h3>

		<aside class="notes">
			Feel like doing some work outside of the console? We got you covered! ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			Since we mentioned programming, it follows that one can work on the tools necessary to
			make the languages work ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			More on the GUI side, there are also game-making tools; really, your imagination is the
			limit ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			Reinventing your own wheel is the most common choice, but there are several GBDev
			projects that are looking for help right now. There is a strong culture of free
			software, so anyone can contribute (and even get paid a little as thanks) ⏭️

	<section>
		<h3>Emulators</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">Sometimes they're on-console (TODO: CHIP-8?)</li>
			<li class="fragment">80% of games = easy</li>
			<li class="fragment">
				Want difficulty? Try emulating
				<a href="http://eldred.fr/blog/prehistorik"><em>Prehistorik Man</em></a>
				pixel-perfectly... or <em>Pinball Deluxe</em> at all!
			</li>
			<li class="fragment">
				Well-understood (<em>mostly</em>), well-documented,
				<a href="https://gbdev.io/chat">a lot of people</a> can help
			</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			Another interesting field is the world of emulation. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			Now, some people write emulators *on* the Game Boy, but due to the system's low specs,
			the opportunities are rare. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			As for emulating the Game Boy itself, it's a common recommendation for newbies, since
			getting it mostly right is not particularly difficult (unlike, say, the NES) ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			That said, if you like challenge, the Game Boy has a *lot* of headaches in store for
			you! Here are two of the more famous expert-level targets, but don't worry, there's
			*plenty* more where that came from :) ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			Overall, it can a fun activity, because the system has been researched a lot *and* said
			research is publicly available; and there are a lot of people who will readily give you
			a hand. ⏭️
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Research</h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment">Running tests on hardware, and making them reproducible</li>
			<li class="fragment">
				Documentation (<a href="https://gbdev.io/pandocs">Pan Docs</a>...)
			</li>
			<li class="fragment">
				Again, can be done as a <a href="https://gbdev.io">community</a> effort
			</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			Although we just said that the system has been studied a lot, believe it or not,
			research on that 35-yo system is STILL ongoing! ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			One notable area of work is writing what we call “test ROMs”, which enable individual
			behaviours to be compared between implementations (including the, yknow, reference one
			:P) ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			And another thing that anyone, yes *you*, can help with, is documenting all of the
			technical details in a more human-friendly and accessible manner. ⏭️<br />
			<br />
			And all of this is also something that other people will gladly help you with! ⏭️
