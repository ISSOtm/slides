			My name is Eldred, ‚è≠Ô∏è but I usually go online by the nick ‚ÄúISSOtm‚Äù. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			I got my first Game Boy late, so I have no nostalgia for it. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			I picked up PHP and JS when I was 13, then immediately got introduced to Z80 assembly,
			aaaaand I got hooked ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			I love strongly-typed languages with a lot of static checks, and being down to the metal
			juggling raw bytes, and have a *strong* distaste for C and C++. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			As of late, my hobby has been mapping out the countryside I live in. ‚è≠Ô∏è

		<h3>Sylvie <small>(she/her)</small></h3>
		<ul>
			<li class="fragment"><img src="assets/sylvie.png" class="float" />Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color fan</li>
			<li class="fragment">Jobs: Typescript, C++, Java, PHP, etc</li>
			<li class="fragment">Hobbies: assembly and some C</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			My name is Sylvie!
			<br />
			My sister and I had an Nintendo 64 as kids, I got a Game Boy Color to play Pok√©mon on,
			and we basically didn't upgrade consoles so I have a <em>lot</em> of nostalgia for them.
			:P
			<br />
			I got into programming on a TI calculator with TI-BASIC. Ironically that's
			<em>also</em> a good platform for assembly programming, in Z80, but there can be some
			other retro dev talk about that.
			<br />
			From there I started doing web development in high school and stuck with programming in
			general as a career.
			<br />
			In that field, there's a lot I like about Typescript, Python, C++, Rust, for how they
			let you do abstract work <em>once</em> and then the high-level compiler or interpreter
			handles it.
			<br />
			But on the other hand, it's a very different feeling from manipulating a computing
			machine at its lowest level, which is why I still like assembly programming as a hobby.
			(Hence this talk!)

	<h2>What can make programming unfun?</h2>
	<aside class="notes">
		Let's get to what you came here for! Since we put ‚Äú**re**discovering‚Äù in the talk's title,

		<h3>Barriers to entry</h3>

				Waiting for long compilation
			</li>
			<li class="fragment">Getting a bunch of dependencies</li>
			<li class="fragment">Needing more powerful hardware</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			The first thing that drains fun is being taken out of ‚Äúthe zone‚Äù to deal with some
			chore. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			For example, waiting for long build times. Raise your hand if you have seen that comic
			somewhere before? ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			There's also stressing your network bandwidth (and waiting some more) while you are
			fetching a whole bunch of libraries... ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			And hardware requirements constantly increasing. ‚è≠Ô∏è

		<aside class="notes">
			Modern game development techniques tend to demand a lot out of a single person, so it

			Speaking of complexity, the raw complexity of the systems also makes it difficult to
			grasp what's going on ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />

		<h3>Hard to wrap your head around</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Many different targets</li>

		<aside class="notes">
			The modern PC platform is very diverse, with a lot of screen sizes, hardware
			combinations and configurations... ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			And each of those targets are moving, to make things worse! ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			This especially hinders debugging, since that necessitates fairly broad understanding of
			the systems you're debugging ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			And, finally, the sensation that things are escaping you just *doesn't feel great* ‚è≠Ô∏è
