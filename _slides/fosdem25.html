			I got my first Game Boy late, so I have no nostalgia for it. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />

			There's a lot I appreciate about high-level languages: functional programming idioms,

	<h2>What can make programming unfun?</h2>
	<aside class="notes">
		üê∂ Let's get to what you came here for! Since we put ‚Äú<em>re</em>discovering‚Äù in the talk's

			<li class="fragment">Getting a bunch of dependencies</li>
			<li class="fragment">Needing more powerful hardware</li>
		</ul>
		<aside class="notes">
			üê± The first thing that drains fun is being taken out of ‚Äúthe zone‚Äù to deal with some
			chore. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			For example, waiting for long build times. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			Stressing your network bandwidth (and waiting some more) while it fetches a whole bunch
			of libraries. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />

		<aside class="notes">
			üê∂ Modern development techniques tend to demand a lot out of many specialized people, so

			<br />
			The modern PC platform is very diverse, with a lot of screen sizes, hardware

			<br />
			And each of those targets are moving, to make things worse! ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			üê∂ This especially hinders debugging, since that necessitates fairly broad understanding

			<li class="fragment">Run: emulators, debuggers</li>

		<aside class="notes">
			üê∂ The Game Boy's tools, SDKs, libraries, and available resources have improved a lot
			over the decades. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			Even pixel art and four-channel music can benefit from the latest programs for creating
			them (no more plotting pixels on graph paper!). ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			You can compile all your source code and graphics into a playable ROM in mere seconds.
			‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			And you can use modern debugging conveniences, like runtime breakpoints and time-travel
			debugging, all within your emulator.

		<aside class="notes">
			üê± The Game Boy's simplicity is refreshing in many ways ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			Not only is it a good support to learn some fundamental lower-level concepts, ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			it remains an interesting object in its own right! ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			Further, one dev (or a small team) can wear more hats at once, without any one of them
			being too big to handle. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			This is, in part, due to the system's lower specs making it easier to have something
			that feels reasonably complete. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			And, yes, the system is under-powered, but that's a *good thing* ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			as the saying goes: ‚Äúlimitations breed creativity‚Äù. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			It can also make it really interesting to have to solve minor challenges to make your

			üê∂ You can use practically any graphics editor to draw things one pixel at a time. But

			The original Game Boy could show exactly four shades its famous ‚Äúpea soup green‚Äù. But

			üê∂ Another interesting field is the world of emulation. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			Emulating the Game Boy on your computer is a common recommendation for newbies, since
			getting it mostly right is not particularly difficult (unlike, say, the NES) ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			üê± That said, if you like a challenge, the Game Boy has a <em>lot</em> of headaches in
			store for you! Here are two of the more famous expert-level targets, but don't worry,
			there's <em>plenty</em> more where that came from :) ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			Some people even write emulators <em>on</em> the Game Boy. Due to the system's low
			specs, the opportunities are rare, but even lower-spec "fantasy consoles" can be done!
			‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			Overall, it can a fun activity, because the system has been researched a lot
			<em>and</em> said research is publicly available; and there are a lot of people who will
			readily give you a hand.

			üê± Although we just said that the system has been studied a lot, believe it or not,
			research on that 35-yo system is STILL ongoing! ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			One notable area of work is writing what we call ‚Äútest ROMs‚Äù, which enable individual
			behaviours to be compared between implementations (including the, y'know, original
			physical one :P) ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			üê∂ And another thing that anyone, yes <em>you</em>, can help with, is documenting all of

			üê∂ Your idea of "what can run on the Game Boy" might be simple games with obviously
			repeating tiled graphics and beep-boop audio. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />

			But the hardware can do a <em>lot</em> more than that. And if you want to try pushing

			<br />
			you can decide to do away with with a game UI, player controls, any of that, and to
