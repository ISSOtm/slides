		<aside class="notes">
			My name is Sylvie!
			<br />
			My sister and I had an Nintendo 64 as kids, I got a Game Boy Color to play Pok√©mon on,
			and we basically didn't upgrade consoles so I have a <em>lot</em> of nostalgia for them.
			:P
			<br />
			I got into programming on a TI calculator with TI-BASIC. Ironically that's
			<em>also</em> a good platform for assembly programming, in Z80, but there can be some
			other retro dev talk about that.
			<br />
			From there I started doing web development in high school and stuck with programming in
			general as a career.
			<br />
			In that field, there's a lot I like about Typescript, Python, C++, Rust, for how they
			let you do abstract work <em>once</em> and then the high-level compiler or interpreter
			handles it.
			<br />
			But on the other hand, it's a very different feeling from manipulating a computing
			machine at its lowest level, which is why I still like assembly programming as a hobby.

		Creating games is, of course, a central part of Game Boy development, but it's not the

			You can use practically any graphics editor to draw things one pixel at a time. But the

			<br />
			Dedicated editors for pixel art have useful features, like working with limited color
			palettes or animating a frame at a time. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			The original Game Boy (code name "Dot Matrix Game", or DMG) could show exactly four
			shades or gray (or a low-contrast green on real hardware). But even then, you can use
			dithering -- varying colors over space, or even over <em>time</em> -- to look like you
			have more. ‚è≠Ô∏è<br />
			<br />
			The Game Boy Color supported 32 <em>thousand</em> whole colors -- but still with its own
			limits around how they're divided into palettes and tiles. But once again, you can use
			artistic and programming trickery to create "high-color" cutscenes or demos.

			Your idea of "what can run on the Game Boy" might be simple games with obviously
			repeating tiled graphics and beep-boop audio. But the hardware can do a <em>lot</em>
			more than that. And if you're not dealing with a game UI, player controls, any of that,
			you can dedicate all your efforts (and all the Game Boy's CPU) to making something that
			looks or sounds years ahead of its time.
